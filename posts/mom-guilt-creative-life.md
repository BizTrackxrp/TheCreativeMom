Hey BTS crew,

This question intrigues me so I'll stay. Take 1, 1:40am.

**Int. home - night**

Patrice sits at her laptop on the couch. Silence in the house. She breathes deeply fully embracing this moment. Her lips release a flow of her, her fingers glide against the keyboard.

Day 2… fyi, mom guilt is real. 

Since becoming a mother, I can fully attest that being a parent, and a mother is my number one love. I stay at home. I live and breathe parenthood, but thoughts of creativity swarm my mind often. What do I do, you ask? Well, sometimes I'm up at 1am. Whether I daydream about an idea that's seeking a way out, or jot it down in my notes, my mind eternally seeks out stories of what to write or what could be a story.

As for mom guilt, I go back and forth about how this term makes me feel. Whether I treat it as a superpower, or feeling guilty about being a necessity for my young children. I love being a mom, I love being needed by my family, and gracefully I have allowed it to consume most of me. With this great power comes great responsibility of passing not so frequent opportunities to not miss time with my kids.

I find this to be most true when passing on opportunities to be on a film set. Thinking, better yet knowing, that the hours would mean long hours away from my kids. Three days, four days of filming.. I think of my kids and repeatedly add up the hours that I will miss them while I am away to work. I wonder, does that make me good, or bad to obsess over this? And now, three years, and one short film in, I have settled into this habit, shamefully and un-shamefully so. Unsure of how long my dependency on them will last for me being willing to be away from them for a moderate amount of time.

Another behind the scenes look, with me, the late night typer. Until next time BTS crew. Sleep tight. 

**Signing off.. 2:07am.**
