**On this week's BTS...**

Nap time with toddlers has been a struggle. IYKYK...

And after weeks of struggling to land on a topic, I've finally found it. This entry was inspired by a conversation that I had with a friend and fellow writer that led to me doing research and deeper thinking on my latest short.

P.S... don't worry, you'll hear more about that soon.

In the conversation, we spoke about whether or not a certain character in my latest short film was necessary and what purpose it served. From my perspective, I thought the purpose of the character was clear. Through mannerisms and characteristics. And the intentional purpose of how she is toward the main character. But that was not yet understood from the first read. So, the question became, how much do we need to tell the audience, and what do we leave for the audience to interpret on their own.

I asked ChatGPT about what some might consider "spelling it out" for an audience vs leaving a character or a moment open for interpretation. It clarified what I was trying to ask and noted it as "clarity vs ambiguity," and it was exactly right. So what does the audience prefer? And which is considered to be correct when it comes to screenwriting?

*(Disclaimer: While I know there is a giant feud against the use of AI and ChatGPT, this is what I find it most useful for — instances like these that help me clarify and find the right words for questions I'm looking to ask. But we'll save that discussion for another time.)*

In screenwriting there isn't just one way.

But one thing that stays consistent is what writers are able to be ambiguous about, and whether or not it leaves vagueness. As opposed to clarity where you completely get the full picture of who, what, and why. Which is precisely why some enjoy one method more than the other. But what truly matters is intention. Leaving the audience to feel invited to think, not confused.

From reading personal blog posts to Studiobinder articles, there are plenty of takes that dive deep into when and why ambiguity or clarity could work in different situations, along with their pros and cons.

In a video I watched while researching for this entry, a vlogger said that "clarity is extremely important, it isn't about holding the cards to your chest, it's about letting the audience in" and that felt very relevant to me as a writer.

One instance of clarity vs ambiguity that instantly came to mind before starting this article is the ending of the show The Sopranos. When Tony Soprano is in the restaurant before all the rest of his family arrives, there is a lot happening. It's crowded. There's music playing. And seemingly meaningless characters that enter before we see who he is waiting for. And it makes me wonder, if there's something in the title of the songs he flips through on the jukebox, or in all the people he sees entering. How he watches them come through the door, or all the people around inside of the restaurant, if that is supposed to give us some sort of clue from the writers to determine whether or not he actually dies at the end of this scene. This ambiguous ending was still very clear on where the writers wanted our minds to go.

For a topic like this, it seems like it could go on forever, and there are many valid points that made me step back and think if I am doing my job correctly as a screenwriter and using ambiguity with intention, or if I'm unintentionally leaving things vague. Moments like this remind me that every choice in screenwriting — how much we reveal, what we withhold, and how we use characters and locations to evoke emotion — has to be deliberate. As writers, our job isn't just to tell a story, but to guide the audience in how they receive it, using only what they can see and feel on the screen.
