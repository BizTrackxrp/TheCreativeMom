★★★★★ (5/5)

There's a scene in *Past Lives* where Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) sit on a New York City playground carousel, speaking Korean after twelve years apart. The camera holds on them as the city blurs behind, creating a bubble of intimacy in the midst of urban chaos. It's one of many moments where Celine Song's directorial debut achieves something rare: capturing the weight of unspoken feelings with remarkable precision.

## The Story

*Past Lives* follows Nora, a Korean-Canadian playwright living in New York, and Hae Sung, her childhood friend from Seoul. After reconnecting online as young adults and then losing touch again, they finally meet in person twelve years later—but Nora is now married to Arthur (John Magaro), an American writer.

The film isn't a typical romance. It's something more complex: a meditation on identity, immigration, choice, and the versions of ourselves we leave behind.

## The Beauty of Restraint

What makes *Past Lives* extraordinary is its restraint. Song trusts her actors and her audience. She doesn't over-explain, doesn't force dramatic confrontations, doesn't resolve ambiguity with false clarity. The film understands that the most profound emotions often exist in silences, in glances, in what remains unsaid.

Greta Lee's performance is a masterclass in subtlety. Watch how she carries herself differently depending on whether she's speaking English or Korean, how her posture changes when she's with Arthur versus Hae Sung. Her Nora contains multitudes—the Seoul girl she was, the New York woman she became, the person she might have been.

## The Third Who Isn't a Wheel

One of the film's most fascinating achievements is its treatment of Arthur, Nora's husband. In a lesser film, he would be an obstacle, the impediment to "true love." But Song and Magaro create something more human. Arthur is perceptive, kind, and secure enough to recognize what's happening without becoming antagonistic. His presence adds emotional complexity rather than simplistic conflict.

The film asks: Can you love someone while also mourning a parallel life where you loved someone else? The answer it suggests is both painful and liberating: yes.

## In-Yun: Invisible Threads

The film's central concept is *in-yun*—a Korean word describing the providence or fate that draws people together through past lives. But Song uses this idea to explore something very contemporary: how we create meaning around our connections, how we tell ourselves stories about destiny and choice.

Is it fate that brought Nora and Hae Sung together, or just Facebook's algorithm? Does it matter? The film suggests that the meaning we make is real, regardless of its source.

## The Immigrant Experience

*Past Lives* is perhaps the most honest film I've seen about what it means to immigrate. Not the dramatic aspects—the leaving, the arriving—but the slow transformation that happens after. The way you exist differently in different languages. How the person you are in your native tongue might not fully map onto who you are in your adopted language.

Nora has become American, but she's also still Korean. These identities don't conflict; they coexist, sometimes uncomfortably. When Hae Sung visits, he represents not just a person but an entire life she could have lived if she'd stayed in Seoul.

## Technical Excellence

Shabier Kirchner's cinematography is painterly without being showy. Every frame is composed with care, but nothing calls attention to itself. The film breathes. It gives us space to think.

Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen's score is sparse and devastating, knowing exactly when to swell and when to let silence do the work.

Song's direction is assured in a way that's almost shocking for a debut. She knows exactly what story she's telling and trusts it completely.

## Why It Resonates

*Past Lives* speaks to anyone who has immigrated, anyone who has chosen one path while wondering about others, anyone who has reconnected with someone from their past and felt the strange vertigo of seeing who you've both become.

It's about the roads not taken. The lives not lived. The versions of ourselves we left behind when we made irrevocable choices.

But it's also about accepting those choices, finding peace with them, understanding that the life we're living is as real and valuable as any alternative we imagine.

## A Perfect Ending

The film's final scene is devastating in its simplicity. I won't spoil it, but it captures something true about love, loss, and the lives we choose. It's an ending that trusts us to sit with complexity, to leave the theater carrying questions rather than answers.

Nora gets in an Uber. Arthur waits on the curb. And in that moment, we understand everything and nothing about what just transpired.

## The Verdict

*Past Lives* is the rare film that gets better with reflection, that unfolds in memory. It's a stunning debut from Celine Song and proof that quiet, thoughtful cinema can create seismic emotional impact.

This is one of the best films of the year, perhaps the decade. It's tender, honest, and heartbreaking in the most beautiful way.

**Rating: ★★★★★**

**See it if:** You appreciate subtle, character-driven drama; you're interested in stories about immigration and identity; you want to see exceptional acting; you believe the best love stories are often bittersweet.

**Skip it if:** You need plot-heavy narratives; you're impatient with slow pacing; you want clear resolutions; you prefer action to contemplation.

## Final Thoughts

After watching *Past Lives*, I called my mother. We talked about immigration, about the person she might have been if our family had stayed in her home country. She'd never really articulated it before, but this film gave us a language to discuss something that had always been there, unspoken.

That's what great art does. It makes visible what was invisible. It gives form to feelings we couldn't name.

*Past Lives* is that kind of film. See it. Think about it. Let it stay with you.

Because it will, whether you want it to or not.
