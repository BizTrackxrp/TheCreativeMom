Take 1… 1:16pm  
Take 2… Day 2 12:30pm

Good afternoon BTS Crew,

I'm glad you're here. If you actually read my takes and keep track of the times that I usually start writing, you can tell that my schedule is pretty sporadic and I take whatever time I can get. I'm glad I've started blogging again and for now it is comforting and sustainable. Creating with two kids is funny, and perhaps why I named my blog the creative mom, because clearly, both are a huge part of my identity. Stick around for the action line and I'll tell you more..

**Fade in:**

**Int. Home - day**

P sneaks away from her family and slips into her writing room, laptop tucked under her arm. She nestles into her spot and begins to type. The sound of a football game and chanting from two toddlers looking for mommy and missing toys rings through the walls. She continues to write.

I love the thought and provocation that comes with creating ideas. It's a part of the process that I genuinely enjoy as an artist. Sitting back and dwelling on what an idea can be, or seeing something play out in front of me that would make a good concept for a film. People have asked me plenty of times before what my style is or what inspires my work, and the simple answer for it is, life.

I tend to generate ideas from a place of curiosity rather than from a desire to "serve a purpose". And of course every story has a purpose, but I am talking about a deep and intentional meaning. Something spiritual, educational or aimed at a specific audience.

As a creative who is still maturing as a filmmaker, I often wonder about that. I wonder if creating deep, impactful work makes me any less of an artist, or makes my work any less valuable to an audience.

And while I have an appreciation for the commitment of artists who are capable of educating others through their art, or who influence a person's understanding and challenge a viewer's way of thinking, that is not a style of writing that I have tried or have been drawn to… Yet?

So. As I sit here writing, I realize and ask myself, what truly matters in art? And when and where do we decide what matters the most? Right? We never really know what will speak to or resonate with someone, so it's best to just create it! Every medium of art and inspiration is an act of vulnerability. A shared offering meant to connect, feel and think, which matters.

If you're like me, and like to wonder if your work will matter to anyone else, chances are it already does.

AND that's a wrap… see you next time.
