The attic smelled of dust and forgotten time. Margaret climbed the creaking wooden stairs, a flashlight cutting through the darkness, searching for her grandmother's old trunk. She'd promised to sort through it before the estate sale next week.

The trunk sat in the corner, covered in a film of gray dust. As Margaret lifted the lid, hinges protesting, she found what she expected: yellowed photographs, vintage costume jewelry, a pressed corsage from some long-ago dance. But beneath it all, wrapped in faded ribbon, were letters. Dozens of them.

## The Discovery

Each envelope bore the same address in her grandmother's careful script, but none had been mailed. Margaret carefully opened the first letter, dated June 1952:

*My dearest Thomas,*

*It's been three months since you left for Seoul, and every day feels like a year. I wait by the radio each evening, hoping for news, hoping you're safe...*

Margaret's hands trembled. She'd never heard her grandmother mention anyone named Thomas. Her grandfather's name had been Robert.

## A Hidden Love

Letter after letter revealed a story Margaret had never known. Thomas, a soldier. Her grandmother, Elena, a nurse at the veterans' hospital where they'd met. A brief, intense love before he shipped out to Korea. And then—silence.

*October 1952*

*I waited for you at the train station today, just like I do every Tuesday. The war is over. Everyone is coming home. But not you. I've written to the War Department twice. No response. Are you alive? Did you forget me? Or is there something they're not telling me?*

Margaret's heart ached reading her grandmother's words, the desperation bleeding through six decades.

*December 1952*

*I'm getting married next month. To Robert. He's kind, and stable, and here. I need to move forward, Thomas. I need to let you go. But I'll never stop wondering what happened to you, what might have been if you'd come home.*

## The Truth

At the bottom of the stack, Margaret found something different—a Western Union telegram, dated November 1952. Official. Brief. Devastating.

*REGRET TO INFORM YOU PFC THOMAS REID KILLED IN ACTION OCTOBER 15 STOP*

It had been sent to her grandmother's parents' address. Had they hidden it from her? Trying to help her move on? The telegram was still in its envelope, opened but then tucked away with the unsent letters.

Her grandmother had known. Eventually. But she'd married Robert anyway. Built a life. Had children. Grandchildren. All while carrying this secret love in her heart.

## The Last Letter

The final letter was dated just three months ago, written in a shaky hand:

*My dearest Thomas,*

*I'm 91 now. Robert passed last year—we had 70 good years together, and I loved him in the way you love someone who becomes your home. But you, Thomas, you were lightning. You were the road not taken, the life I didn't live.*

*I'll see you soon, I think. And maybe, finally, I'll get to mail these letters.*

Margaret sat in the dusty attic, tears streaming down her face, clutching her grandmother's words. She thought about love—the kind that lasts a lifetime and the kind that lasts forever. Sometimes they're the same love. Sometimes they're different.

And sometimes, she realized, they both matter.

## Epilogue

Three weeks later, Margaret stood at Thomas Reid's grave in Arlington National Cemetery. She'd found it after hours of searching military records. The stone was simple, weathered.

She placed the stack of letters at its base, each one finally reaching its destination after 72 years.

"She never forgot you," Margaret whispered. "She wanted you to know."

The wind picked up, rustling through the letters, and for just a moment, Margaret could have sworn she heard something that sounded like gratitude.
