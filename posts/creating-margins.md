It's 5:47 AM. The house is quiet. My coffee is hot. My notebook is open. I have exactly 43 minutes before the first kid wakes up.

This is my time. These are my margins.

## The Myth of "Someday"

Before kids, I believed in "someday." Someday I'd have time to write that novel. Someday I'd learn photography. Someday I'd start that creative project I've been thinking about for years.

Motherhood demolished that myth with the efficiency of a toddler destroying a tower of blocks. There is no someday. There is only now, in whatever fragmented form it takes.

The choice became clear: create in the margins or don't create at all.

I chose the margins.

## What Are the Margins?

The margins are:
- 5:47 AM before the house wakes
- Naptime (when naps actually happen)
- 10 minutes in the car during soccer practice
- Late nights after bedtime stories
- Waiting rooms, pickup lines, bathroom breaks
- The spaces between obligations

These aren't ideal creative conditions. There's no quiet studio, no uninterrupted afternoon, no romantic writer's retreat. Just stolen moments, often measured in minutes.

And yet.

## The Unexpected Gift

Here's what I've learned: constraints can be liberating.

When you have four hours to write, you can procrastinate for three and a half. When you have fifteen minutes, you write. You don't overthink. You don't wait for inspiration. You show up and do the work because you know this time is finite and precious.

The margins have made me efficient. They've made me focused. They've stripped away everything but the essential: the desire to create.

## The Notebook

I carry a small notebook everywhere now. It's battered, pages bent, covered in coffee rings. Inside are:
- Story ideas scribbled at red lights
- Dialogue overheard at the playground
- Observations written while dinner cooks
- Half-formed thoughts captured before they dissolve

This notebook has become my most valuable creative tool. Not because it contains brilliant work—most of it is rough, fragmentary, barely coherent. But because it represents showing up. Again and again and again.

## The Guilt

Let me be honest: there's guilt. 

Guilt when I wake early to write instead of sleeping. Guilt when I'm mentally composing a sentence while my kid tells me about their day. Guilt for wanting something that's mine, separate from motherhood.

But I've learned that creativity isn't selfish—it's sustaining. I'm a better mother when I'm also a creator. When I have something of my own, some part of my identity that exists independent of caregiving.

My kids don't need a martyr. They need a mother who shows them that it's okay to have passions, to pursue interests, to be a whole person with a rich inner life.

## What I've Created in the Margins

In the past year, in these stolen moments, I've:
- Written 47 short pieces
- Completed a photo essay project
- Started this magazine blog
- Drafted half a novel
- Kept a daily gratitude journal
- Read 52 books

None of this would have happened if I'd waited for ideal conditions. If I'd waited for someday.

## The 10-Minute Rule

My strategy is simple: if I have 10 minutes, I create something.

It doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't have to be complete. It just has to exist.

Ten minutes of writing. Ten minutes of photography. Ten minutes of sketching. These small investments compound. They add up to something real.

## For Other Parent-Creators

If you're struggling to find time for your creative work, know that you're not alone. The tension between artistic ambition and parental responsibility is real. The exhaustion is real. The guilt is real.

But also know that:

**You don't need hours.** You need consistency. Ten minutes a day beats one marathon session that happens never.

**You don't need perfect conditions.** You need permission to create imperfectly, in whatever space and time you can find.

**You don't need to choose.** You can be a parent AND a creator. They can coexist, even if messily.

**You don't need to wait.** The margins are available right now. Today. This moment.

## The Long View

My daughter is four. She sees me writing in my notebook sometimes. Once she asked what I was doing.

"Creating something," I told her.

"Can I create too?"

Now we create together sometimes, in our margins. She draws while I write. We're both making something from nothing, both honoring the impulse to express, to make, to share.

This might be the most important lesson I can teach her: that creativity isn't a luxury reserved for people with time and space. It's a practice available to anyone willing to work in the margins.

## The Coffee Gets Cold

It's 6:30 now. I hear small feet padding down the hall. My 43 minutes are up. My coffee has gone cold.

But I've written this. In the margins. Between the obligations. In the space I've carved out for myself.

Tomorrow I'll do it again. And the day after that.

Because the margins, it turns out, are where the magic happens. Not despite the constraints, but because of them.
